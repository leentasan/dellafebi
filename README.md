# Hi, ThereðŸ‘‹
I'm a 2th-year IT student at UGM, always on the lookout for new things to learn and ways to level up my skills. I'm still exploring different areas of IT. I have learn web dev and UI/UX but lately i have interest in data science. Ready to trade memes and insights with fellow data enthusiasts. Hit me up!
